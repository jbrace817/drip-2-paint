Your home's exterior isn't just about curb appealâ€”it's your property's first line of defense against harsh Northeast weather. At Drip Painting, we combine premium materials with expert craftsmanship to deliver stunning, long-lasting results that protect and beautify your home.

### Comprehensive Exterior Solutions


Our exterior painting services go beyond just walls. We expertly handle every exterior surface of your home, including trim, shutters, doors, decks, and architectural details. Working with top paint brands like Sherwin-Williams, Benjamin Moore, and PPE, we help you select the perfect products to ensure maximum durability and protection against the Northeast's challenging weather conditions.

#### Our Premium Preparation Process


We believe exceptional results start with thorough preparation. Our comprehensive process includes:

1. Complete exterior inspection and documentation of any damage
2. High-pressure washing to remove dirt, mildew, and loose paint
3. Expert wood repair and replacement of any rotted sections
4. Thorough scraping and sanding of loose paint

6. Premium primer application on bare wood and problem areas
7. Protection of all landscaping, windows, and non-painted surfaces

### Northeast Weather Protection


Living in the Northeast presents unique challenges for your home's exterior, from freezing winters to humid summers. Our expertise specifically addresses the region's demanding climate conditions. We implement specialized techniques to prevent moisture damage and wood rot, while ensuring your paint withstands extreme temperature fluctuations. Our solutions provide robust protection against UV damage, color fading, and the harsh effects of ice and snow. We pay particular attention to shaded areas where mildew and algae tend to thrive, implementing preventive measures to maintain your home's appearance year-round.

### Industry-Leading Warranty


While most companies in the industry offer a standard 5-year warranty, we proudly stand behind our work with a 6-year guarantee on all exterior painting projects. This extended protection reflects our confidence in our workmanship and materials, giving you peace of mind that your investment is secured by our unwavering commitment to quality.

### Professional Color Consultation


Selecting the perfect exterior colors can feel overwhelming, but our color specialists make the process enjoyable and confident. We guide you through selecting colors that complement your home's architectural style while considering neighborhood aesthetics and any HOA requirements. Our consultation includes detailed discussions about trim, shutters, and architectural details to create a cohesive look. We provide large color samples to test in different lighting conditions, ensuring you'll be delighted with the final result.
