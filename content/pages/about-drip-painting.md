### Our Story

Drip Painting began with a simple act of neighborly kindness. In 2010, founder Floyd Miles helped a neighbor refresh their living room with a new coat of paint. Seeing their joy and amazement at how a fresh palette transformed their space ignited something in Floyd – a realization that his skill could bring genuine happiness to others.

What started as occasional weekend projects for friends and family quickly grew through word-of-mouth. By 2015, Floyd took the leap to establish Drip Painting as a full-service painting company. From those humble beginnings, we've grown into a trusted name for interior painting, exterior painting, and custom kitchen and bathroom remodeling throughout the region.

We're committed to creating spaces that not only look beautiful but enhance the way you live.
